# DisplayCtl uvx Integration Summary

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

DisplayCtl now fully supports `uvx` usage with the following structure:

### Package Structure
```
displayctl/
├── pyproject.toml           # Python package configuration
├── src/displayctl/
│   ├── __init__.py         # Package initialization
│   ├── __main__.py         # Support for `python -m displayctl`
│   └── cli.py              # Main CLI implementation
├── README.md               # Updated with uvx instructions
├── UVX_USAGE.md           # Detailed uvx usage guide
├── displayctl.py          # Original standalone script (still works)
├── install.sh             # Installation script (updated)
└── dist/                  # Built package wheel
```

### uvx Command Support

Once published to PyPI, these commands will work:

```bash
# One-time usage (no installation)
uvx displayctl current
uvx displayctl save work-setup
uvx displayctl load work-setup
uvx displayctl list
uvx displayctl delete old-config

# Install for repeated use
uvx install displayctl
displayctl current
```

### Key Features for uvx

1. **Proper Python Package**: Uses `pyproject.toml` with modern packaging standards
2. **Entry Point**: Configured CLI entry point (`displayctl = "displayctl.cli:main"`)
3. **Dependency Handling**: `dbus-python` dependency properly declared
4. **Module Support**: Can be run with `python -m displayctl`
5. **Platform Specific**: Linux-only dependency specification

## 🚀 Publishing to PyPI

To make `uvx displayctl` work globally:

```bash
# Install publishing tools
pip install twine

# Build the package
python -m build

# Publish to PyPI (requires PyPI account)
twine upload dist/*
```

## 🎯 Benefits of uvx Integration

1. **Zero Setup**: No manual dependency installation needed
2. **Isolation**: Doesn't pollute global Python environment  
3. **Automatic Updates**: Easy to run latest version
4. **Cross-Platform**: Works on any Linux system with uvx
5. **Professional**: Standard Python packaging practices

## 📝 Usage Examples

```bash
# Show current monitor setup
uvx displayctl current

# Save dual monitor setup for work
uvx displayctl save work-dual-monitor

# Save laptop-only setup for travel
uvx displayctl save laptop-only

# Switch between setups
uvx displayctl load work-dual-monitor
uvx displayctl load laptop-only

# List all saved configurations
uvx displayctl list
```

The package is now ready for publication and will provide a seamless "Just Works™" experience with uvx!
